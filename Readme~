1. To run just run make and then run ./max_bandwidth
2. A output.txt file will contain the statistics of the test run.
3. I have also added a test graph to the file. To run the test graph
you will have to uncomment the #debug line in grap_data_struct.h
4. Please note that if you are using your own test graph file
you will need to change the number vertices in the grap_data_struct.h
Also the format of the file is the first line contains number of edges E
and the following E lines contain v w weight.
